Pros of TDD:  
Improved Code Quality: By writing tests first, developers focus on requirements and potential edge cases upfront. This approach often yields more stable and error-resistant code.  

Better Code Design: TDD tends to produce more modular and easily maintainable code. Since developers are writing tests beforehand, they naturally design functions and classes that are simpler to test and integrate.  

Immediate Feedback: The cycle of TDD provides developers with immediate feedback on their code. This immediate validation means that if something is amiss, it's identified and addressed promptly, reducing future debugging time.  

Cons of TDD:  
Learning Curve: For those unfamiliar with TDD, there can be a significant learning curve. Understanding how to write effective tests and adapting to the "tests first" mindset can be challenging initially.  

Initial Development Pace: While TDD can save time in the long run by reducing bugs, it might make the initial phase of development feel slower, as tests are written before any functional code.  

Risk of Overengineering: With an emphasis on extensive test coverage, there's a possibility that developers might introduce unnecessary complexity to the code.  

False Sense of Security: Passing tests don't guarantee a bug-free application. The efficacy of TDD relies heavily on the quality of the tests written, and poorly crafted tests can overlook vital scenarios.
