# ECE444-Lab5-TDD  
Pros:  
1. Improved Code Quality: Since developers write tests first, they can focus on the requirements and edge cases. This often results in more robust and less buggy code.  
2. Better Code Design: TDD can lead to more modular and maintainable code. When writing tests first, developers often create more modular functions and classes to make the testing process easier.  
3. Immediate Feedback: Developers get immediate feedback when writing the code. If a function doesn't work as expected, they know right away.  

Cons:  
1. Steep Learning Curve: Developers new to TDD might find it challenging to write tests first or might struggle with writing effective tests.  
2. Slower Initial Development: Writing tests before the actual code can slow down the initial development process.  
3. Risk of Overengineering: With a focus on writing tests for every bit of functionality, there's a potential to overengineer solutions.  
4. False Sense of Security: Just because all tests pass doesn't mean the software is bug-free. Poorly written tests might miss crucial scenarios or edge cases.
